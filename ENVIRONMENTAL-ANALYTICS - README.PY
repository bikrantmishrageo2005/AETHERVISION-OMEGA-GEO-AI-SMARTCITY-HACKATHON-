Citywide Pollution Analysis & Environmental Problem Mapping Module


---

📌 Overview

Branch 2 focuses on identifying and explaining the real environmental problems that cities face.
This module studies every major pollution type and converts them into GIS-ready, digital twin–compatible layers.

It forms the problem understanding layer of AetherVision Omega, ensuring that the AI engine knows what issues exist before providing solutions.

🎯 What This Module Covers

This branch documents and analyzes all major pollution categories, including:

Air Pollution

Water Pollution

Soil/ Land Pollution

Noise Pollution

Industrial Emissions

Groundwater Quality Issues

E-waste & Solid Waste

Bio-medical Waste Hazards

Hazardous Chemical Zones

Agricultural Pollution (pesticides, fertilizers)

Urban Heat Island Zones

Traffic-induced pollution hotspots


Each pollution type is explained in simple language, with examples and city impact.

📍 Purpose of Branch 2

This module provides:

1. Clear problem identification

Explains what pollution exists, why it happens, and who is affected.

2. Smart City–level impact analysis

Helps understand how each pollution type harms:

Human health

Water systems

Soil productivity

Urban climate

Biodiversity

Infrastructure


3. GIS-ready problem layers

Each pollution category becomes a separate layer that can connect with:

Branch 1: Digital Twin System

Branch 3: GEO-AI Fusion Engine

Branch 4+: Any future AI models


4. Foundational input for AI decision making

Branch 3 and 4 cannot function without this problem model.
