Branch 8 — Autonomous SmartCity Decision Engine

AetherVision Omega – Final AI Recommendation Module


---

Overview

The Autonomous SmartCity Decision Engine is the final and most important module of AetherVision Omega.
It converts city-level hazard data into actionable recommendations using a rule-based AI logic system.

This engine interprets environmental stress indicators (air, heat, rainfall, seismic, waste) and generates a decision score plus a human-readable improvement plan for each city.

This is what transforms the project from “analysis” → real strategic action.

Objectives

Identify top environmental pressures on each city

Convert hazard metrics into a unified decision score

Generate targeted recommendations for immediate action

Help city authorities plan smart and safe interventions

Complete the final intelligence loop of AetherVision Omega

Key Features

1. Multi-Stressor Decision Score

Based on normalized environmental and disaster indicators:

Air Quality

Heat Stress

Rainfall/Flood Risk

Seismic Risk

Waste Management Index


Weighted model:

Decision Score =
(AQI × 0.30)
+ (Heat Stress × 0.20)
+ (Rainfall × 0.20)
+ (Seismic Risk × 0.15)
+ (Waste Index × 0.15)

Higher score = more critical environmental condition.

2. AI-Based Recommendation Engine

The system automatically generates AI-driven interventions such as:

Emission control

Cooling shelters

Drainage strengthening

Seismic safety checks

Waste segregation improvements


If no major risk exists:

No immediate interventions required.

3. SmartCity Improvement Report

A final summary text file is generated for judges:

City

Decision Score

Recommendations


This is perfect for hackathon presentations and project justification.

How It Works

Step 1

Environmental indicators are generated (or imported) for each city.

Step 2

Normalization is applied.

Step 3

Weighted model computes the decision score.

Step 4

Rule-based AI logic selects the best interventions.

Step 5

Outputs are exported for dashboards, reports, and presentations.

Role in AetherVision Omega

This is the final intelligence layer of your entire system.

It completes the pipeline:

Branch 1 → Digital Twin

Branch 2 → Environmental Analysis

Branch 3 → Fusion Engine

Branch 4 → Risk Model

Branch 5 → Forecasting

Branch 6 → GeoHealth

Branch 7 → Early Warning

Branch 8 → Final Recommendations (Action)


Judges will see a full SmartCity brain:
From sensing → analyzing → forecasting → deciding.


---

Importance in Hackathon

This branch proves:

You provide solutions, not just maps

AI is recommending actual interventions

Your system is practical for real city governance

Demonstrates maturity, depth, and real-world value


This will significantly boost your final judging score.
