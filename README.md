# AETHERVISION-OMEGA-GEO-AI-SMARTCITY-HACKATHON-
AetherVision Omega is an AI-powered Digital Twin GeoAI system for smart cities. It integrates air pollution, water quality, geology, climate stress and industrial hazards into one interactive risk dashboard. Built for hackathon model creation, multi-hazard planning and pollution mitigation.

# 🌐 AetherVision Omega — GeoAI SmartCity (Hackathon Project)

AetherVision Omega is an AI-powered Digital Twin system built to help cities understand pollution, hazards and environmental stress in a simple, visual and scientific way.  
It brings air quality, water quality, industrial zones, earthquakes, heat islands and groundwater information into one interactive smart-city dashboard.

This project is designed for hackathon model creation and shows how GeoAI can support safer, cleaner and smarter cities.

## 🚀 What This System Does

### **1. Digital Twin Base**
- India boundary loaded using GeoJSON  
- Acts as the foundation of the smart-city model

### **2. Pollution Monitoring**
- Air Quality (AQI) heatmap  
- Industrial zone markers  
- Water pollution sample points  

### **3. Geological & Disaster Layers**
- Earthquake hotspots  
- Landslide-prone regions  
- Fault-line and tectonic stress zones  

### **4. Climate & Urban Stress Layers**
- Urban Heat Island areas  
- Groundwater depletion zones  
- Suggested green belts & eco-barriers
(Earthquake × 0.30) + (Landslide × 0.20) + (Air Pollution × 0.15) + (Industry Emission × 0.15) + (Heat Stress × 0.10) + (Groundwater Stress × 0.10)

Creates the final **SmartCity Risk Map**.

### **6. Interactive Dashboard**
- Turn layers on/off  
- Explore hotspots  
- Compare different hazard zones  
- View smart-city risk levels  

All outputs are generated as **HTML maps** and included in the ZIP folder.

## 🧩 Goal of This Project

To demonstrate how GeoAI + Digital Twin technology can help cities predict risks, plan better and stay safe.  
This is the **first module**, and more modules (app, 3D model, full HyperCity) will be added.
