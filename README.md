AetherVision Omega – HyperCity GeoAI SmartCity System

India’s First End-to-End GeoAI Environment + Hazard + SmartCity Decision Platform

8-Branch Autonomous Multi-Hazard Intelligence Engine


---

🌍 Overview

AetherVision Omega is an advanced GeoAI SmartCity Brain designed to monitor, predict, and solve urban hazards using environmental analytics, machine learning, digital twins, and autonomous decision systems.

This project integrates 8 powerful intelligence branches, creating a single unified system capable of:

Environmental monitoring

AI-driven hazard forecasting

Digital twin visualization

Real-time alerts

Public health analytics

Multi-hazard fusion

Disaster early warning

Autonomous city-level decision-making


The platform currently supports all major Indian cities, making it instantly deployable for governance, hackathons, and smart-city challenges.

🎯 System Architecture (8-Core Intelligence Branches)

Below is the full list of the eight branches that together form the HyperCity AI system.


---

1. Branch 1 — Core Digital Twin (Pan-India Environmental Mapping)

Builds a full digital twin foundation for India:

Base map

Feature layers

Pollution layers

Geological layers

SmartCity visualization


Outputs:
HTML maps, layers, overlays.


---

2. Branch 2 — Environmental Analytics Engine

Studies all 14 major pollution categories, including:

Air, water, soil

Noise, waste

Industrial pollution

Heat islands


This branch defines real-world problems for the AI engine.


---

3. Branch 3 — GeoAI Fusion Engine

Creates combined risk maps using:

Air pollution

Water quality

Urban heat

Landslide/flood zones

Industrial hotspots


Generates a unified fusion risk score and heatmap.


---

4. Branch 4 — Real-Time Risk Model

Computes dynamic multi-hazard risk levels using weighted AI scoring.

Outputs:

Risk heatmaps

Hazard score tables

City markers

Risk-level classification



---

5. Branch 5 — Urban Hazard Forecasting Engine

AI-based 7-day prediction module, modeling:

Future pollution

Weather trends

Urban stress

Hazard score trajectories


Outputs CSV, forecast heatmap, and text report.


---

6. Branch 6 — City GeoHealth Dashboard

Links environmental data with public health impact:

AQI

Heat Index

Water Quality

Population Density


Generates health score + GeoHealth map.


---

7. Branch 7 — Early Warning Alert System (48-hr)

Real-time hazard alert engine:

Seismic

Heat

Rainfall

Pollution

Wind


Generates RED / ORANGE / YELLOW alerts for 48 hours.


---

8. Branch 8 — Autonomous SmartCity Decision Engine

Final recommendation AI:

Reads every hazard

Generates decision scores

Produces actionable city solutions


Outputs:

SmartCity decision CSV

Recommendation report


This is the brain of the full system.
