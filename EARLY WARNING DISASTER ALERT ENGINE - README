Branch 7 — Early Warning Disaster Alert Engine

AetherVision Omega – Real-Time Risk Prediction Module


---

Overview

The Early Warning Disaster Alert Engine is a real-time prediction module designed to forecast urgent environmental and disaster-related hazards for the next 48 hours.
It analyzes rapidly changing atmospheric, climatic, and seismic conditions and generates automated alert levels for every major metro city.

This engine enables a Smart City to respond early to life-threatening hazards.

Objectives

The system predicts short-term hazards using:

Air quality levels

Heat stress

Rainfall intensity

Wind speed

Seismic activity


It produces three key outputs:

1. Real-time hazard dataset (48 hours)


2. AI-based alert classification


3. Human-readable alert report

Features

1. Real-Time Environmental Data Simulation

Generates 48-hour synthetic high-frequency data for:

AQI

Heat index

Rainfall (mm/h)

Wind speed (km/h)

Seismic activity (Richter scale)


2. Hazard Scoring Algorithm

Each environmental factor is weighted to compute a final hazard score:

Hazard Score =
(AQI × 0.30) +
(Heat Index × 0.20) +
(Rainfall × 0.20) +
(Wind Speed × 0.10) +
(Seismic Activity × 0.20)

3. Alert Level Classification

Based on the hazard score:

RED ALERT  → Extreme danger

ORANGE ALERT → High risk

YELLOW ALERT → Moderate risk

NORMAL → Safe


4. 48-Hour Forecast Window

The engine predicts hazards for each hour across 48 hours for all tracked cities.
